    <p align="left">Remix Icon is a set of neutral system symbols for designers and developers. Unlike a patchwork icon library, More than 1200 icons are all elaborately crafted so that they are born with the gene of readability, consistency and perfect pixels. Each icon was designed in "Outlined" and "Filled" styles based on a 24x24 grid. Of course, all the icons are free to use.</p>
